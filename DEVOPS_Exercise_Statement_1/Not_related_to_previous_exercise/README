Terraform files are part of a module named infra-modules-security-k8s-service, they are used to deploy and manage a secure Kubernetes service within 118Money AWS Cloud environment. The modules cover IAM roles for access management, security groups for network security, and configurations for managing Terraform state in a collaborative setting. The use of variables enhances flexibility and reusability, while the presence of an outputs file helps in retrieving important details about the deployed resources post-deployment.
