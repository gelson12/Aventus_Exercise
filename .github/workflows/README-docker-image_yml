There are still quite some improvements and best practices thet needed to be implemented to enhance its functionality, efficiency, and maintainability:

1. Use Latest Action Versions
Ensure you are using the latest versions of the actions. For example, actions/checkout@v3, docker/login-action@v2, and docker/setup-buildx-action@v2. Using the latest versions can provide improvements, new features, and security fixes.

- name: Checkout code
  uses: actions/checkout@v3

- name: Log in to Docker Hub
  uses: docker/login-action@v2

- name: Set up Docker Buildx
  uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v2



2. Dynamic Tagging
Instead of hardcoding the Docker image tag to latest, consider using dynamic tags based on the GitHub SHA or other metadata like the branch name or tags. This can help with version tracking and rollback.

tags: |
  gelsonm/aventus-app:latest
  gelsonm/aventus-app:${{ github.sha }}


3. Multi-platform Builds
If your application targets multiple architectures (e.g., amd64, arm64), you can leverage Buildx's ability to build multi-platform images.

platforms: linux/amd64,linux/arm64


4. Build Arguments and Secrets
If your Docker build requires build-time arguments or secrets, you can pass them using the build-args and secret-files options.

build-args: |
  SOME_ARG=${{ secrets.SOME_SECRET }}
5. Caching for Faster Builds
Use caching to speed up the Docker build process. The Buildx action supports using a cache from GitHub's cache or directly from Docker Hub.

cache-from: type=gha
cache-to: type=gha,mode=max


6. Conditional Execution
For workflows that might not need to run on every push (e.g., documentation changes), use conditional execution to skip the workflow.

if: "!contains(github.event.head_commit.message, 'skip ci')"


7. Security: Scan the Docker Image
Integrate a Docker image scanning tool like Trivy to scan your image for vulnerabilities before pushing it to the registry.

- name: Scan image for vulnerabilities
  uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@v0.5.7
  with:
    image-ref: 'gelsonm/aventus-app:latest'
    format: 'table'
    exit-code: '1'
    ignore-unfixed: true


8. Notifications
Consider adding a step to notify me or the team when the Docker image has been successfully built and pushed, or if the workflow fails.

9. Full Untested Improved workflow:
name: Build and Push Docker image

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - DEVOPS_Exercise_Statement_1

jobs:
  build-and-push:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: "!contains(github.event.head_commit.message, 'skip ci')"
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Log in to Docker Hub
      uses: docker/login-action@v2
      with:
        username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
        password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}

    - name: Set up Docker Buildx
      uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v2

    - name: Build and push
      uses: docker/build-push-action@v2
      with:
        context: ./DEVOPS_Exercise_Statement_1/Dockerize_the_Backend/
        file: ./DEVOPS_Exercise_Statement_1/Dockerize_the_Backend/Dockerfile
        push: true
        tags: |
          gelsonm/aventus-app:latest
          gelsonm/aventus-app:${{ github.sha }}
        platforms: linux/amd64,linux/arm64
        cache-from: type=gha
        cache-to: type=gha,mode=max

    - name: Scan image for vulnerabilities
      uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@v0.5.7
      with:
        image-ref: 'gelsonm/aventus-app:latest'
        format: 'table'
        exit-code: '1'
        ignore-unfixed: true
