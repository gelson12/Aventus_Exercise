DEVOPS Exercise Statement 1
Backend with Two Endpoints

PLAN
1. Going to Setup a Python project with Flask by:

    * Creating Flask webframework to /populate and /delete endpoints.
    * Use SQLAlchemy for ORM with PostgreSQL.
    * The /populate endpoint will generates random data and inserts it into the database.
    * The /delete endpoint will deletes all data from the database.

EXERCISE: COMPLETED
TESTED: YES

2. Dockerize the Backend

    * Create a Dockerfile and Docker-compose that sets up a Python environment, installs dependencies, and runs the backend application.
    * Use a multi-stage build for smaller image size if possible.

EXERCISE: COMPLETED
TESTED: YES

3. GitHub CI for Docker Image

* Setted up GitHub Actions workflow in ".github/workflow" directory to build and push the Docker image to Docker Hub upon new commits to the main branch.

EXERCISE: COMPLETED
TESTED: YES

4. Helm Chart for Deployment

* Created a Helm chart that includes:
    * Deployment for the backend application.
    * A PostgreSQL database deployment , including PVCs for data persistence.
    * Configured to initialize the database schema on first run.
    * A deployment for a web-based PostgreSQL UI (e.g., PGAdmin) accessible securely.
    * Included values.yaml for customizable deployment options.

EXERCISE: COMPLETED
TESTED: YES



5. Not related to previous exercise:
   a. Share some terraform code and/or module that is using the AWS provider that was developed by you.

EXERCISE: COMPLETED
TESTED: YES


DEVOPS Exercise Statement 2

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Using Terraform

1. Terraform Setup for AWS Resources

    * Define a Python script that generates a file with random data.
    * Use AWS Lambda to run this script, packaging the Python script within the Lambda deployment package.
    * Trigger the Lambda function through AWS API Gateway, set up with a custom domain.
    * Configure the S3 bucket in a separate AWS account, handling cross-account permissions correctly for Lambda to write to it.

EXERCISE: COMPLETED
TESTED: UNTESTED

2. GitHub Actions for Deployment

    * Create a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to deploy the Terraform code.
    * Ensure the pipeline includes steps for Terraform initialization, validation, plan, and apply.
    * Use secrets for sensitive information like AWS credentials.

EXERCISE: PENDING
TESTED: UNTESTED

Helm Charts Sharing
* Provide examples of Helm charts you've developed, showcasing how you structure charts, manage dependencies, configure templates, and utilize values for deployment customization.

EXERCISE: CLASSIFIED UNABLE TO SHARE
TESTED: CLASSIFIED UNABLE TO SHARE
